### Create alarms
I created alarms by following the below steps
#### Create an SNS topic using CLI
I created the SNS topic using AWS CLI 

#### Create Billing alarms using CLI
I created a billing alarm that measures the DailyEstimatedCharges. I put the threshhold to $1 dollar to ensure I am able to track my actual spending.

### create Budgets
I worked on the budgets bit using aws console, and created a zero spend budget to ensure that I get a notification once we start using paid services. My budget is to spend a maximum of $20 per month in this project. My total budget spend for the whole program is $60. I will create an extra budget alarm as the program progress.
