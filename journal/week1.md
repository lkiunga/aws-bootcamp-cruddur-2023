# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Contains an outline of all the activities for week 1 - THis tasks were completed during the period of week 3 since, I had an ongoing project at work that was completing that week, hence required all my attention, but now we are back and working to catch up with the work from the other weeks.

### Watch How to Ask for Technical Help
THis was really helpful, I loved the advice made that you need to first show effort before you can ask for help so that people can answer you by helping you demystify how well you understand the problem you are solving. Through this approach I'm able to solve most issues even witthout asking for help first.
### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
I was able to containerize both the frontend and backend applications by creating docker files. 
I was able to create a compose file and run the app as a multi container - this was a really cool feature. The docker compose feature is especially useful in that it supports variables and moving composition between environments.
